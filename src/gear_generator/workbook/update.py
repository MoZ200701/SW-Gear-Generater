"""What Update SolidWorks would change, and recording what it did (docs/PLAN-WORKBOOK.md §4.5, phase W4).

Pure, on the Tk thread: :func:`classify` compares the linked file's latest
read with the link record and says what Update SolidWorks carries — part
values, the layout's globals, components re-placed — or why a new revision is
needed instead; :func:`finish_update` turns what the worker did
(``swbuild.GearboxUpdate``) into the sidecars and record to save. The worker
runs ``swbuild.update_gearbox(session, **plan.update_kwargs())`` and nothing
else. No COM, no Tk; the file system only through injected callables.

Interfaces pinned in the W4 interface commit; every body that raises
NotImplementedError is Agent B's.

**What is structural** (a new revision, offered after asking): a gear, shaft
or mesh added, removed or renamed; a coordinate that changes side or reaches
or leaves 0 (a layout plane cannot follow a global across its base plane); a
built part whose gears now want different parts (a split); a part whose
resulting stem changes; and ``swbuild.structural_change`` on what is left,
once the plans and stems have been compared and the fields a kind ignores
normalised (decision 5: a spur gear's Hand, a Part name equal to the default
stem, are not). **A value update**: the kind's variable texts differ. **A
move**: X or Y on the same side (the layout's globals), Z, Z± or At (while the
assembly is static). Speeds, torques and efficiencies change nothing in
SolidWorks. A part keeps its file name after a value update (N68 holding 69
teeth).

The record is compared for the sentence before the press; the worker compares
with SolidWorks live, so Update stays enabled even when the record says
nothing differs (an unsaved or lost update is put right).
